separate(control\_arm, into = c("data", "period", "control\_arm"), sep = "/") %&gt;% select(-data, -period)

Tidying the dataframe so that variable 'week' is in one column rather than spread out.
======================================================================================

long\_gather = gather(long\_tidy, key = week, value = n, week\_1:week\_8) %&gt;% separate(week, into = c("number", "week"), sep = "\_") %&gt;% select(-number)

Making of spaghetti plot
========================

long\_spaghetti = long\_gather %&gt;% distinct() %&gt;% group\_by(id.csv)

ggplot(long\_spaghetti, aes(x = week, y = n, group = id.csv, color = control\_arm)) + geom\_path()

%&gt;% separate(id.csv, into = c("id", "csv"), sep = ".")
=========================================================

brfss\_smart2010 %&gt;% select(year, locationabbr, locationdesc) %&gt;% distinct() %&gt;% group\_by(year) %&gt;% count(locationabbr) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) + geom\_path() + labs(title = "Location count for each state by year") + viridis::scale\_color\_viridis( name = "locationabbr", discrete = TRUE)

brfss\_spaghetti = brfss %&gt;% group\_by(locationabbr, year) %&gt;% distinct(locationdesc) %&gt;% summarize(location\_numbers = n()) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = location\_numbers, color = locationabbr)) + geom\_line()

    ## )

### Description of raw data:

The homicide\_data shows the numbers of homicides within the

``` r
# Making of the new variable 'city_state'
homicide_citystate = homicide_data %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", " , state)) %>%
  select(disposition, city_state)
```

homicide\_summarize = homicide\_citystate %&gt;% mutate(total\_homicide = disposition) %&gt;% mutate(unsolved\_homicides = recode(disposition != "Close by arrest"))

mutate(unsolved\_homicides = filter(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest")))

homicide\_summarize %&gt;% group\_by(city\_state, disposition) %&gt;% count()

balitmore = homicide\_summarize %&gt;% filter(city\_state == "Baltimore, MD") %&gt;% prop.test \`\`\`
